# Homebrew GNOME Apps

A collection of GNOME GTK 4 apps ported to macOS. Note that all of these apps are *unofficial* ports - report any issues experienced on this repo and ***not*** upstream.

The following apps are packaged:

| Program       | Version |
|---------------|---------|
| GNOME Builder | 43      |
| Rnote         | 0.5.4   |
|               |         |

## How do I install these formulae?

**Important:** You cannot have homebrew's `libgit2-glib` installed. It conflicts with the formula in this repo.

To install GNOME Builder, run the following command:

```
brew tap mjakeman/gnome
brew install mjakeman/gnome/gnome-builder
```

This may take quite some time.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
